# How to

_For now, this project is targetting Windows (personal needs)._

## Notes

This should work with node LTS (16.17.0 as of today).

This project was created in order for offshore colleagues to have a pass-through proxy running under the same port as local developers. With this, we can run the same project and set of settings on different computer configurations.

## Certificates

1. Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).
2. Run `mkcert -install`
